# Config for gulp

This is my personal base gulp configuration.

# What include:
- Simple assebling source files to the build
- Creating local server
- Auto-refreshing browser window when file modification happened
- Cleaning old build version
- Converting SCSS/SASS to css
- Auto-collecting css media to end of file
- Minimizing css, js and images files
